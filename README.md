A simple package with functions to run power simulations for mixed-effects models, simulated using the lmer package.

Functions allow to specify number of simulations, ranges of effect size estimates, random slope variance, residual error variance, number of groups, number of within-group observations.

WIP
Functions are finalized but documentation is still in progress.
